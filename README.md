# ESP32-S3 Tennis Monitoring Wearable

Tennis performance wearable firmware for the **Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.06** smartwatch. Worn on the hitting hand, it detects strokes with a dual-gate gyroscope algorithm, logs full-rate IMU data to SD for offline analysis, and lets you tag point outcomes live during a match.

Built with **ESP-IDF v5.5.2** + **LVGL 9**.

## Hardware

| Component | Chip | Bus |
|-----------|------|-----|
| MCU | ESP32-S3R8 (8 MB PSRAM) | — |
| Display | SH8601 AMOLED 410×502 | QSPI |
| Touch | FT3168 | I²C |
| IMU | QMI8658 (accel + gyro) | I²C |
| PMIC | AXP2101 | I²C |
| RTC | PCF85063A | I²C |
| Audio | ES8311 + NS4150B | I²S |
| Storage | microSD | SDMMC 1-bit |

## Features

- **Home** — battery, live clock, mode selection; AMOLED dim-to-clock screen-sleep.
- **Test & Tune** — live hit detection with on-device ω/α threshold tuning and SD recording (HIT-capture or ALL modes).
- **Play** — play/pause match logging with a 5-slice outcome ring (good hit, out, bad hit, unforced error, ace), an opponent GOOD/BAD pair, and a manual set scoreboard (game circles: tap +1, hold to −1) that auto-ends the set; per-session folder with hit log + outcome/score counts.
- **Config** — handedness, on-demand WiFi→NTP clock sync, live RTC date/time, firmware version.
- **Power management** — IMU idled off the tuning screen, DFS, screen-sleep.

## Using the watch

Two physical buttons drive navigation (the touchscreen handles on-screen controls):

- **BOOT (GPIO0)** — **back** to the Home screen (from Test it also stops & saves any active recording).
- **PWR (GPIO10)** — power on; on **Home** opens **Config**; in **Play** it's **play/pause**.

| Battery, live clock, and two big buttons: **PLAY** and **TEST**. Dims to a clock-only sleep after 30 s — tap to wake. | Live hit counter; tune detection with **−/+** around **wT** (ω) and **aT** (α); **RESET** the detector; **HIT/ALL** mode; **REC** to record to SD. |

| Tap a slice to tag each of your shots — good hit, out, bad hit, unforced error, ace — or the **OPPONENT** GOOD/BAD pair for theirs. Keep the set score on the **OPP/YOU** game circles (tap +1, hold 1 s for −1); the set auto-ends (6 with a 2-game lead, or 7) and freezes with a **SET x–y** banner. Center shows **PLAY/PAUSE** (toggle with PWR). | Pick your **playing hand** (improves forehand/backhand analysis), **Sync Clock** over WiFi/NTP, and check the live date/time. Firmware version shown top-right. |

### Recording a session

1. **Set your hand** in Config (Right/Left), and **Sync Clock** once so files are dated correctly.
2. > **Note:** Clock synchronization requires a `/sdcard/wifi.txt` file. Put the WiFi SSID on the first line and the password on the second line. Optional lines such as `UTC=2` and `summerTime=true` can be added to configure the local timezone.
3. **Play mode** (Home → PLAY): press **PWR** to start (**PLAY**). Tag your shots on the ring and the opponent's on the **OPPONENT** GOOD/BAD pair, and keep the set score on the **OPP/YOU** game circles (tap +1, hold 1 s for −1). **PWR** pauses between games (game circles stay editable while paused); the set auto-ends at 6 (with a 2-game lead) or 7 and freezes with a **SET x–y** banner. Press **BOOT** when done. A folder `PlaySession_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM/` is written to the SD with `hits.csv`, `outcomes.txt` (outcome + opponent counts + final set score), and `events.csv` (timestamped tags + game changes). The session also auto-ends on low battery (≤3 %) or 30 min idle.
4. **Test & Tune** (Home → TEST): press **REC** to log raw IMU to `ses_NNN_full.csv` (ALL) or `ses_NNN_hit.csv` (HIT-capture) for offline analysis.

### Analysing a session (`scripts/`)

```bash
python scripts/session_report.py Data/PlaySession_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM   # -> report.html
```
Generates a session report (strokes, rallies, forehand/backhand, swing speed, outcomes). Run `scripts/calibrate.py` once on a labeled block recording to enable calibrated forehand/backhand + spin (topspin/flat/slice).

## Hit detection

Dual-gate on gyro magnitude **ω** = √(gx²+gy²+gz²) and angular acceleration **α** = |Δω/dt|, with an alpha look-back window to bridge the rising-edge/peak gap. State machine: IDLE → IN_HIT → REFRACTORY. See [`HIT_DETECTION_SPEC.md`](HIT_DETECTION_SPEC.md).
